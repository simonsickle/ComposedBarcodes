Composed Barcodes
=================

Make barcode views with ease in Jetpack Compose.

Gradle users:

```
implementation("com.simonsickle:composed-barcodes:1.1.1")
```

Examples
--------

Displaying barcodes is super easy! Simply call the composable in your layout.

```kotlin
val URL = "https://github.com/simonsickle/ComposedBarcodes"
// Make sure the value is valid for the type of barcode selected. The library will
// just show an infinite spinner in place of a barcode if the data is not valid.
if (BarcodeType.QR_CODE.isValueValid(URL)) {
    Barcode(
        modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally)
            .width(150.dp)
            .height(150.dp),
        resolutionFactor = 10, // Optionally, increase the resolution of the generated image
        type = BarcodeType.QR_CODE, // pick the type of barcode you want to render
        value = URL // The textual representation of this code
    )
}

// You must handle invalid data yourself
if (!BarcodeType.CODE_128.isValueValid(URL)) {
    Text("this is not code 128 compatible")
}
```
